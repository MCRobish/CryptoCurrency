# CryptoCurrency

The purpose of this project was to take cryptocurrency data and clean up the data to be able to use in a clustering machine learning method. The end goal of the project is to create classifications of cryptocurrency types that can help drive investment decisions. First a PCA algorithm was used to reduce the number of dimensions in the data in order to group more efficiently. This data was reduced to 3 dimensions. 

Then, a KMeans model was used to group the data into 4 clusters. 4 was decided to be the suitable number of clusters using an Elbow diagram. The clusters were visualized on a 3D scatter plot and the tables were updated with the class type and the coin names.
